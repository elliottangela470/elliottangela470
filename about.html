					<h2> <B>LOVE</B>
						There is no falling "in" or 
						"out" of it. When you truly
						Love, it never dies. Love 
						is eternal, it's sacred,
						it's a way of life... not
						some temporary feeling that
						loses its truth over time. 
						People only fall "out" of
						Love, when they never truly
						Loved to begin with.

						 <p><b>A little about me:</b>  When I finshed my two years of prerequisite classes at the University Of Central Oklahoma College. 
							I traveled to France for the summer, where I lived with a family in a small village two hours outside of Paris.  
									Jean Piere picked me up from Charles-de-Gauelle Aeroport and whisk me down the Autobahn.
							While he was driving 120 mph he told me how he had flown on the Air Force One and all his life accomplishments. 
							He strongly advised me to get into the technology business.  
							I learned so much during my 3 months stay. It inspired me to get a job in the travel industry when I came back to The United States.</p>
							
								<p> I saught out employment with a french owned company by the name of Club Med.  It was the first all inclusive vacation company in the world. 
							I decided to call and ask how I could apply for a job.  The receptionist Diane said, there are two ways to work for Club Med. 
							Come in to our office in Scottsdale and fill out a application. If you are hired you start answering phones in reservations. 
							The other way to gain employment is to go to American Express Travel School, located in Phoenix. Once you gradute you will have a two month internship. If your goal is to work for Club Med we offer American Express Travel School graduates immediate internship placement. 
							Once your internship ends you will be placed on a team in the flight department. I chose that route. 
						   
							<p>I loaded up my honda civic with my two cats and my basset hound. I dropped all of my classes, I had enrolled in at OU. 
						   I moved from Norman, Oklahoma to Scottsdale, AZ. I rented a one bedroom apartment, applied for a job at Busters Restaurant, the day I arrived. 
						   I was hired and started working that day. I was able to accomplish all of this within 48 hours of my arrival.
						   <p>I made enough money to pay for American Express Travel School.
						   I graduted at the top of my class. I did my internship at Club Med in the Scottsdale office. After my internship, I was hired in the flight department. 
						   I traveled to Europe 5 times while working for Club Med.  
						   I have experinced life in a way that has helped me stay grounded and see what great
						   possibilies are ahead of me. I would say, I am rich in life.  
						   I was able to accomplish all of these amazings experinces before I married and had children.</p>
									</p>			
						
							   
						   <p>I am starting the thrid chapter of my life as a single mom with two amazing children. I want this chapter to resemble all of my life accomplishments prior to being married.  
						   I want to show my children a life, they have only been able to dream about through my pictures from the past.  
							   It is time the three of us start <b>"living our lives as it should be"</b> instead of <b>"living life as it is".</b> </p>
						
						  <p>It is so exciting to see how diverse the field of coding, truly is. I am looking forward to the opportunities that lay ahead. I have what it takes to learn HTML, JS, CSS in addition to all the other languages required. The code way of life is the key to success.
						   I am all in! I am a scuba diver, who has been on shark feedings! I have jumped out of an airplane and landed in the ocean!  There is no way, I am ever giving up!</p> 
						   
									   <p><b>The sky is the limit... Anything is possible!</b></p>

									   <p><b> NEVER BE AFRAID TO START OVER... IT'S A CHANCE TO REBUILD YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANTED ALL ALONG.</b></p>      </b></p>
